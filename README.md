==Description==

This scatterplot graph displays the thirty-five fastest bicycle times up Alpe d'Huez, a ski resort located in the Central French Western Alps. It displays the time in minutes on the y-axis and the year on the x-axis. The scatterplot points for riders who have doping allegations are in red and the scatterplot points for riders who have no doping allegations are in blue. Users can hover over each point to see the name of the rider, the country of the rider, the year the ride occurred, the length of the ride in minutes, and learn more about the doping allegations for the riders who have them.
